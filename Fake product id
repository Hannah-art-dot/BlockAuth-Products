This project demonstrates how blockchain can enhance product authenticity and supply chain trust.

Features

✅ Add and verify products on the blockchain

✅ Detect counterfeit products in real-time

✅ Secure, tamper-proof product records

✅ Integration with MetaMask for blockchain account management

✅ User-friendly web interface
